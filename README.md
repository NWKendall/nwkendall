### Hi there 👋

Thanks for checking out my page! 

A little bit about me:
After providing ABA therapy to kids with Autism for four years, the automation of information processing increasingly became a bigger issue. No doubt it's a similar story in other fields too.

The realization dawned:

**EVERYTHING IS BEING AUTOMATED. EVERYTHING IS GOING ONLINE.**

Fortunately, I've always had a fascination with computers being an avid hobbyist. This further inspired me to learn and become a software engineer. So I took the plunge to change my career with Lambda School in their Full Stack Web Development program. [I graduated in August 2020]("https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/d911bb88-157a-4d09-80ec-60c7f224fb45/public_url") 

And I haven't looked back! 👍
